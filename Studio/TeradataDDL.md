# Teradata DDL

As you develop the model for your Teradata instance schemas, tables, columns with their data types, as well as indexes and constraints, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding DDL scripts.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).
