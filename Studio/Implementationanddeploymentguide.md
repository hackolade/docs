# Implementation and deployment guide

A well-defined and comprehensive implementation strategy is critical to the successful deployment of the data modeling solution.&nbsp; This page and the pages below in this section constitute a guide that can serve as an example to kick start and inspire your effort

&nbsp;

Below is a possible implementation and deployment roadmap:

&nbsp;

**🚀 Implementation Roadmap**

### 🎨 Phase 1: Solution Architecture \& Design

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 🧭 **Deployment Strategy** | • **Client-based install** on user laptops/desktops (ideal for power users/modelers), or possibly on a persistent Virtual Machine. • **Security-first browser-based deployment** using Hackolade's documented Single-Page App approach via **Azure Front Door**. |
| 🔐 **Security Architecture** | Review [Hackolade's secure SPA architecture](<Security-firstbrowserdeployment.md>) with your InfoSec team. Ensure alignment with corporate secure access policies. |


&nbsp;

### 🖥️ Phase 2: Installation \& Access

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 💻 **Client App Installation** | Distribute Hackolade Studio to data modelers, either by letting them [download](<https://hackolade.com/download.html>) directly onto their respective machines, or via standard software deployment tools. Confirm access to local file system and Git repositories. |
| 🔐 **User Access \& Roles** | Define user groups, access policies, and permissions in Git repository provider. |
| 🗂️ **Configure Git Repository Folders** | Create Git folders structure, possibly by domain: /common, /sales, /HR, /finance, etc. |
| 🧪 **Test \& Validate** | Ensure that users can access and run Hackolade Studio in their preferred mode (client for authors, or browser for read-only viewers). Validate that the Command-Line Interface and Git integration work as expected. |


&nbsp;

**🗺️ Phase 3: Planning \& Strategy**

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 🔍 **Assessment \& Inventory** | Identify all current data models, databases, and integrations. Categorize them by criticality and complexity. |
| 👥 **Stakeholder Alignment** | Engage DBAs, data architects, data modelers, devs, and governance teams. Define goals and KPIs for migration. |
| 🎯 **Scope Definition** | Choose what to migrate (logical, physical, naming standards, glossaries, reverse-engineered models, etc.). |


&nbsp;

**🧪 Phase 4: Pilot Execution**

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **Select Pilot Model(s)** | Choose 1–3 representative models |
| 🔁 **Model Conversion** | Convert models in Hackolade Studio using, if required (PowerDesigner files can be imported directly in Hackolade Studio), export of data models from legacy tools to XSD, then import via reverse-engineering into Hackolade, plus possible manual adjustments. Validate equivalence. |
| 🔍 **Validation \& QA** | Compare schemas, constraints, metadata, and relationships side-by-side. Involve Subject-Matter Experts to confirm semantic fidelity. |
| 📘 **Documentation** | Document lessons learned, challenges, and required standards or conventions in Hackolade. |
| 🧠 **Team Training** | Leverage Hackolade's [online user documentation](<WelcometoHackoladeStudio.md>), [tutorials](<Tutorial.md>), [how-to guides](<How-toguides.md>), and an [eLearning platform](<https://community.hackolade.com/slides/all> "target=\"\_blank\"") with self-paced progressive video tutorials.&nbsp; If necessary, request a workshop with Hackolade for data modelers and engineers using Hackolade Studio’s interface and CLI. |


&nbsp;

**🏗️ Phase 5: Gradual Rollout**

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 📦 **Batch Migration** | Group remaining models by team, domain, or platform. |
| 🛠️ **Automation Setup** | Use CLI + Git integration to automate validation, DDL generation, and schema versioning in CI/CD. |
| 🔗 **Integration Review** | Replace or adapt tooling (e.g., reverse-engineering scripts, BI model imports, or governance connectors). |
| 📊 **Governance Alignment** | Establish schema evolution controls via Git workflows. |


&nbsp;

**📈 Phase 6: Optimization \& Adoption**

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 🧭 **Modeling Standards** | Define Hackolade-based conventions (naming, library of reusable objects/models, modeling patterns, documentation styles). |
| 🔁 **Feedback Loops** | Run retrospectives with teams after each wave. Adapt the migration playbook accordingly. |
| 📚 **Knowledge Base** | Create internal guides, templates, and video walkthroughs. |
| 🧬 **Ongoing Improvements** | Explore advanced Hackolade features like compare é merge, custom properties, model verification, and CLI automation in pipelines. |
