# Protobuf

Protocol Buffers (a.k.a. Protobuf) are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.&nbsp; You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

&nbsp;

One common use of them is to define [gRPC](<https://grpc.io/> "target=\"\_blank\"") specifications — essentially a form of remote procedure calls. With gRPC service definitions, you create a “service” that has RPC methods. These RPC methods take a request “message” and return a response “message”.

&nbsp;

Similar to Apache Avro, Protobuf is a method of serializing structured data. A message format is defined in a .proto file and you can generate code from it in many languages including Java, Python, C++, C#, Go and Ruby. Unlike Avro however, Protobuf does not serialize schema with the message. So, in order to deserialize the message, you need the schema in the consumer, or a Protobuf schema registry.

&nbsp;

Since Confluent Platform version 5.5, Protobuf and JSON schemas are now supported.&nbsp; Pulsar Schema Registry also allows Protobuf structures.

&nbsp;

Hackolade is a visual editor for **Protobuf schema** for non-programmers. To perform data modeling for Protobuf schema with Hackolade, you must first download the Protobuf [plugin](<https://hackolade.com/help/DownloadadditionalDBtargetplugin.html> "target=\"\_blank\"").  

&nbsp;

Hackolade was specially adapted to support the schema design of Protobuf schema. The application closely follows the Protobuf terminology.

## Protobuf Schema

Protocol buffer style has evolved over time.&nbsp; You may want to read this article about the differences between [Proto2 vs Proto3](<https://www.crankuptheamps.com/blog/posts/2017/10/12/protobuf-battle-of-the-syntaxes/> "target=\"\_blank\"").&nbsp; Hackolade supports both.

&nbsp;

Protobuf message schemas are defined in a .proto file which can be easily generated from Hackolade. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

All files should be ordered in the following manner:

1. License header (if applicable)
1. File overview
1. Syntax
1. Packages
1. Imports
1. File options
1. Everything else

&nbsp;

Multiple message types can be defined in a single .proto file. This is useful if you are defining multiple related messages. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Each field is assigned a so-called field number, which has to be unique in a message type. These numbers identify the fields when the message is serialized to the Protobuf binary format. Google suggests using numbers 1 through 15 for most frequently used fields because it takes one byte to encode them.&nbsp; The numbers being auto-generated by the application during script generation, you amy influence the numbering through simple ordering of the fields.

&nbsp;

## Field rules

In Proto2, you could specify that message fields are one of the following:

* required: a well-formed message must have exactly one of this field.
* optional: a well-formed message can have zero or one of this field (but not more than one).
* repeated: this field can be repeated any number of times (including zero) in a well-formed message. The order of the repeated values will be preserved.

&nbsp;

You should be very careful about marking fields as required. If at some point you wish to stop writing or sending a required field, it will be problematic to change the field to an optional field – old readers will consider messages without this field to be incomplete and may reject or drop them unintentionally. You should consider writing application-specific custom validation routines for your buffers instead.

&nbsp;

A second issue with required fields appears when someone adds a value to an enum. In this case, the unrecognized enum value is treated as if it were missing, which also causes the required value check to fail.

&nbsp;

In Proto3, it seemed that they originally dropped the possibility to have optional fields.&nbsp; Then they reinstated that with 3.15.0 [https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.15.0](<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.15.0>) but implemented differently.

Message fields can be one of the following:

* singular: a well-formed message can have zero or one of this field (but not more than one). And this is the default field rule for proto3 syntax.
* repeated: this field can be repeated any number of times (including zero) in a well-formed message. The order of the repeated values will be preserved.

&nbsp;

As a result, it should be noted that null is not supported directly as a data type.&nbsp; But is supported either via optional in proto2 or singular in proto3, though not explicitly.&nbsp; You may want to read this article on [Protobuf and Null support](<https://itnext.io/protobuf-and-null-support-1908a15311b6> "target=\"\_blank\"").

## Data Types

Protobuf supports different families of data types: [scalar](<https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#scalar> "target=\"\_blank\"") (**string, bytes, int, fixed, double, float, bool,** and **any**) and nested (**message, enumeration, map**). &nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Fields may also consist of sub-messages that are defined in the same proto file, or any imported proto files.

&nbsp;

## Forward-Engineering

Hackolade dynamically generates Protobuf schema for the structure created with the application.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This structure can be forward-engineered to a file with .proto extension or copied/pasted to code.&nbsp; It can also be forward-engineered to a [Confluent or Pulsar Schema Registry](<ConfluentSchemaRegistry.md>) instance.

## Reverse-Engineering

Hackolade easily imports the schema from .proto files to represent the corresponding Entity Relationship Diagram and schema structure.&nbsp; You may also import and convert from JSON Schema and documents.

&nbsp;

## Cloud Object Storage

In the context of large-scale distributed systems like data lakes, data is often stored in object storage solutions like Amazon S3, Azure ADLS, or Google Cloud Storage.&nbsp; Protobuf is designed to be a compact and efficient binary format for serializing data.

&nbsp;

With Hackolade Studio, you can reverse-engineer Protobuf files located on:

\- Amazon S3

\- Azure Blob Storage

\- Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen 1 and Gen 2

\- Google Cloud Storage

&nbsp;

## Schema Registries

A key component of event streaming is to enable broad compatibility between applications connecting to Kafka. In a large organizations, trying to ensure data compatibility can be difficult and ultimately ineffective, so schemas should be handled as “contracts” between producers and consumers.

&nbsp;

The main benefit of using a Schema Registry is that it provides a centralized way to manage and version Protobuf schemas, which can be critical for maintaining data compatibility and ensuring data quality in a Kafka ecosystem.

&nbsp;

Hackolade Studio supports Protobuf schema maintenance in:

\- [Confluent Schema Registry](<ConfluentSchemaRegistry.md>)

\- [Azure EventHubs Schema Registry](<EventHubsAzureSchemaRegistry.md>)

\- [Pulsar Schema Registry](<PulsarSchemaRegistry.md>)

&nbsp;

Schemas can be published to the registry via forward-engineering, or reverse-engineered from these schema registries.
