# Hub deployment

To deploy your Model Hub instance:

&nbsp;

\- first make sure to review the [Model Hub prerequisites](<ModelHubprerequisites.md>) and check that you are ready to proceed with the deployment

\- execute the steps describing the [OCI stack deployment](<OCIstackdeployment.md>)

\- provide Hackolade support with the [necessary parameters to connect](<Parameterstoconnectfront-endandb.md>) the front-end application with your database

&nbsp;

Once Hackolade support notifies you of the completion of your setup, you are ready to operate your Model Hub.

&nbsp;

During operations of your Model Hub, you will likely need to:

\- [configure the Git repository source(s)](<Gitrepoconfiguration.md>)&nbsp;

\- [add or remove Model Hub users](<ModelHubusermanagement.md>)

\- [monitor the Oracle database instance](<OCImonitoringofModelHub.md>)
