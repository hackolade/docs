# Diagram Views

This feature of Hackolade Studio is often called "subject area" or "sub-model" in legacy data modeling tools.

&nbsp;

With v4.3.2, Hackolade Studio has the possibility to add separate ER Diagram Views (ERDV): a subset of entities selected from the main ER diagram, to help manage large models by focusing on a smaller set of entities, by domain or subject.&nbsp; Entities may appear in multiple Diagram Views.&nbsp; Modifications made inside Diagram Views are immediately reflected in the main diagram and other views where present.&nbsp; And vice-versa.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A new Diagram View can be added in different ways:

&#49;) from the Actions menu option:

![Menu Actions](<lib/Menu Actions.png>)

&nbsp;

&#50;) from the toolbar:

![Toolbar Create Diagram View](<lib/Toolbar Create Diagram View.png>): toolbar button

&nbsp;

&#51;) from the Object Browser or the main Entity Relationship Diagram:

by selecting one or more entities, then doing a right-click on an entity to display the contextual menu:

![Contextual menu add ERDV](<lib/Contextual menu add ERDV.png>)

&nbsp;

Editing an ER Diagram View name or membership is done from the contextual menu of the Object Browser:

![Contextual menu edit ERDV](<lib/Contextual menu edit ERDV.png>)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In this dialog, you may edit the name of the Diagram View and modify the selection of the entities selected:

![ERDV editor](<lib/ERDV editor.png>)

&nbsp;

Display options are specific to each diagram view, and independent of the display options of the main ER Diagram.&nbsp; This allows you to define different Diagram Views with possibly the same containers and entities, while using different display options.&nbsp; This can be useful for data model storytelling.
