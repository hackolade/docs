# Lessons Learned

We recognize the importance of incorporating lessons learned from past implementations to ensure a successful deployment of the Hackolade Studio solution in your organization. &nbsp;

## Lack of Git repository to store Hackolade Studio data models

In past implementations, lack of version control early in the deployment process led to difficulties in tracking changes across teams. As a result, we learned the importance of establishing version control infrastructure (like Git repositories) at the start of the project. Itâ€™s essential to involve IT teams early to facilitate the Git setup and ensure users are properly trained on Git workflows.

&nbsp;

## Resistance to change by users

In previous projects, gradual phased rollouts helped manage resistance. Over-communicating the benefits in terms of user productivity helped reduce pushback.

&nbsp;

## Integration issues with existing tools (e.g., Git, CI/CD, data pipelines)

Previous integrations taught us to involve all IT stakeholders early and ensure clear documentation of tool dependencies. This reduces surprises later in the project.

&nbsp;

## Data model inaccuracies during migration

In prior migrations, performing smaller test migrations helped catch issues early and reduced errors in full-scale migration.

&nbsp;

## Overlooking governance and compliance requirements

Previous experience in regulated industries emphasized the importance of early involvement from compliance teams to define clear boundaries and requirements for tools.

&nbsp;

## User adoption delays due to complexity

In prior projects, a pilot-first approach significantly reduced the risk of widespread delays by allowing teams to adjust to the tool gradually.

&nbsp;

## Inadequate data model reuse and standardization

From previous migrations, we learned that model libraries and reuse strategies (such as conformed dimensions, references to external models, derive from Polyglot, help ensure long-term scalability and consistency across teams.

&nbsp;

## Misunderstanding of the data security risk

In past implementations, teams have delayed projects due to misconceptions. Once the local, offline architecture was clearly explained, adoption proceeded smoothly. Early, transparent communication with security and IT stakeholders is now part of all pre-deployment phases.
