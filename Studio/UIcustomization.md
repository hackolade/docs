# UI customization

Many aspects of the User Interface and behavior can be customized for the preferences of each user.

&nbsp;

In the menu Tools \> Options you can adjust many of the default parameters shipped with the application:

&nbsp;

![Tools - Options preferences](<lib/Tools - Options preferences.png>)

The sections include paramters for:

* General
* Display
* Default paths
* Reverse-engineering
* Reverse-engineering
* Documentation
* Network Proxy
* Naming Conventions
* Repository

&nbsp;

The preferences are generally stored in local encrypted storage.&nbsp; Some are stored in the .hackolade folder so they can be shared using Git, as detailed [here](<https://hackolade.com/help/Userdefinedcustomproperties.html#Share%20customization%20with%20team%20members>).

&nbsp;

Preferences can be backed up to be exported, so they can be moved to another computer, as explained in [this page](<https://hackolade.com/help/Movingtoanothercomputer.html#Personal%20preferences%20and%20connection%20settings>).

&nbsp;

## Options for model objects

Each object has an Options tab in the Properties Pane, for example:

![ERD display options tab-font style and color](<lib/ERD display options tab-font style and color.png>)

&nbsp;

Many more options are further described in [this page](<https://hackolade.com/help/EntityboxesinERdiagram.html#Display%20options>).
