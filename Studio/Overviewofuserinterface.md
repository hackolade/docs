# Overview of user interface

We have taken a minimalist approach to the design of the application to make it both intuitive and powerful.&nbsp; We avoid to bloat the application with seldom used functionality and endless menu options that are hard to understand. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

As a result, the approach to achieve the tools use cases may be different than other tools, and the terminology might differ as well.&nbsp; It is therefore useful to familiarize yourself with the specifics of this application by reviewing this section.&nbsp; It may also be useful to consult some [tips and tricks](<Tipsandtricks.md>).

&nbsp;

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the application layout and navigation:

* [Welcome page](<Welcomepage.md>)
* [Workspace](<Workspace.md>)
* [Manipulating shapes](<Manipulatingshapes.md>)
* [Compare and merge models](<Compareandmergemodels.md>)
* [Model documentation](<Generatedocumentation.md>)
* [Shortcut keys](<Shortcutkeys.md>)
