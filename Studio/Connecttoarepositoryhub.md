# Connect to a repository hub

A repository hub is a platform hosting repositories remotely and securely. [GitHub](<https://github.com/> "target=\"\_blank\""), [GitLab](<https://gitlab.com/> "target=\"\_blank\""), [Bitbucket](<https://bitbucket.org> "target=\"\_blank\"") and [Azure DevOps Repos](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/> "target=\"\_blank\"") are such platforms, just to name a few.

&nbsp;

Besides securing your remote repositories, these hubs provide additional features on top of the standard feature set of Git.&nbsp; For example, the peer review feature is a very popular extension to Git that is supported by most of the repository hubs. It allows changes made by a user to be reviewed and approved by another user before being merged into a target branch.

&nbsp;

Hackolade Studio is integrating with most of the popular repository hubs to bring peer review capabilities right into the application. You can [submit for review](<Submitforreview.md>) the changes made in a repository, without leaving Hackolade Studio.&nbsp; You can also list and [review change requests](<Reviewchangerequests.md>) submitted by other contributors.&nbsp; This review process is made easy by the data model visualization features of Hackolade Studio.&nbsp; Instead of presenting a complex text diff screen, Hackolade Studio shows graphically what has been modified in a data model using its [compare view](<Compareandmergemodels.md>).&nbsp; This helps understand changes, and decide whether they are legitimate.

&nbsp;

**Note:** you only need to read the information below if you use the hub workflow features to [submit for review](<Submitforreview.md>) or [review change requests](<Reviewchangerequests.md>).&nbsp; But in order to get access to the peer review features in Hackolade Studio, you need to configure how it connects to your repository hub.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Automatic connection configuration

If you already cloned a repository from your repository hub, you can just open your local clone in Hackolade Studio.&nbsp; It automatically tries to connect to your repository hub by reusing your existing Git credentials.&nbsp; So if you see your username displayed in the top right corner of the repository view, it means that Hackolade Studio successfully connected to your repository hub.&nbsp; You can start using the peer review features right away, no additional configuration is needed.

&nbsp;

Note that Hackolade Studio only tries to configure the connection automatically if you open a repository cloned over HTTPS.&nbsp; It is not possible to configure the connection automatically for a repository over SSH.&nbsp; In this case, you must configure the connection manually, following the instructions below.

&nbsp;

## Manual connection configuration

If Hackolade Studio is not yet connected to your repository hub, a blue link in the top right corner of the repository view invites you to configure the connection:

![Workgroup - hub connection manual](<lib/Workgroup - hub connection manual.png>)

Alternatively, when you access the peer review features in the left menu, a placeholder invites you to connect to the repository hub.

&nbsp;

When you click on the connect link / button, a connection management dialog opens up.&nbsp; You may also open this dialog from the menu bar, by clicking on *Repository* \> *Manage Repository Connections*.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To create a new connection, you must:

* select a provider from the list (the hub provider for the active repository, if any, should be selected by default);
* provide the host domain name for the selected provider. This info is pre-filled and read-only for standard providers running in the cloud (e.g. GitHub). It is blank and editable for providers running on-premises;
* select how to authenticate. The personal access token method is supported by most providers. See next pages for more details, as each hub provider has a different process to generate tokens;
* click on "Connect" to save the setup and close the dialog.

&nbsp;

### Personal access tokens

You can connect to most of the repository hubs by using a personal access token.&nbsp; Such a token is like a very complex password that is generated by your repository hub, typically to allow 3rd-party applications such as Hackolade Studio to connect securely.

&nbsp;

A personal access token can be revoked.&nbsp; It can have an expiration date, which forces you to update it regularly in order to increase the level of security.&nbsp; It can and should be restricted to a minimum subset of permissions (the so-called *OAuth* *scopes*).

&nbsp;

If you don't have sufficient rights to issue tokens, you may have to request one from your administrator.

&nbsp;

See pages below for information on how your repository hub generates tokens.

&nbsp;

### OAuth

As an alternative to generating a personal access token, some repository hubs also can grant Hackolade Studio access to your account through [OAuth](<https://oauth.net/> "target=\"\_blank\""). Follow the instructions guiding you through the authentication steps specific to each provider.

&nbsp;

## Edit a connection

You may need to edit an existing connection, for example if your personal access token has expired.&nbsp; You must then provide a new token.

&nbsp;

Open the connection management dialog from the menu bar by clicking on *Repository* \> *Manage Repository Connections, or* click on the link in the top right corner of the repository view.

&nbsp;

Then select the connection you want to edit, click on the "Edit" button, modify the necessary parameters, and save your changes by clicking on the "Connect" button.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Delete a connection

To delete an existing connection, open the connection management dialog from the menu bar by clicking on *Repository* \> *Manage Repository Connections,* or click on the link in the top right corner of the repository view.

&nbsp;

Then select the connection you want to delete, and click on the "Disconnect" button.
