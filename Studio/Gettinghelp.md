# Getting help

The different options currently available are:

* [eLearning platform](<https://community.hackolade.com/slides/all>) with self-paced tutorials
* Read the online [manual](<http://hackolade.com/help> "target=\"\_blank\"")&nbsp;
* Watch these short [videos](<http://hackolade.com/videos.html> "target=\"\_blank\"")&nbsp;
* Send an [email](<mailto:support@hackolade.com>) to open a support ticket to [support@hackolade.com](<mailto:support@hackolade.com?subject=Hackolade%20Studio%20question>)

&nbsp;

## When opening a ticket

It is useful to share precise and detailed information in order to speed up troubleshooting and resolution:

\- context: provide information about your situation, what you’re trying to accomplish

\- steps to reproduce: list the different steps leading to the error message, and ideally provide the data model file.  If necessary, you may mask information in the model file with File \> Save Obfuscated As…

\- current behavior: describe what happened.  In most case, it is useful to provide screenshots or a short movie capture.&nbsp;

\- expected behavior: explain what result or output you would expect for the operation.  In some cases, it may help to illustrate with a mockup.

\- additional information : provide other details that might help with troubleshooting and a speedy response to your request.

\- log files: information from the application logs can be immensely helpful for our development team to diagnose and resolve the issue, ideally captured immediately after the issue occurred. Log files can be found:

\-- Windows: in the C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\HackoladeLogs directory

\-- Mac/Linux: in the Users/$USER/Documents/HackoladeLogs folder.

&nbsp;

## The XY problem

When creating a ticket for support, it may also be helpful to take into consideration the following...

&nbsp;

The [XY problem](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY\_problem> "target=\"\_blank\"") arises when someone attempts to solve problem X, and uses solution Y in an attempt to solve problem X, then also faces challenges with solution Y. Instead of seeking help for problem X, they request support for solution Y, obscuring the root cause and leading to miscommunication, wasted time, and suboptimal solutions.

&nbsp;

The XY problem is further described [here](<https://xyproblem.info/> "target=\"\_blank\""):&nbsp; In particular, it describes what to do about it:

* Always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted solution.
* If someone asks for more information, do provide details.
* If there are other solutions you've already ruled out, share why you've ruled them out. This gives more information about your requirements.

&nbsp;

The kind of answers you will get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer.

&nbsp;
