# Getting help

The different options currently available are:

* [eLearning platform](<https://community.hackolade.com/slides/all>) with self-paced tutorials
* Read the online [manual](<http://hackolade.com/help> "target=\"\_blank\"")&nbsp;
* Watch these short [videos](<http://hackolade.com/videos.html> "target=\"\_blank\"")&nbsp;
* Send an [email](<mailto:support@hackolade.com>) to open a support ticket to [support@hackolade.com](<mailto:support@hackolade.com?subject=Hackolade%20Studio%20question>)

&nbsp;

## When opening a ticket

It is useful to share precise and detailed information in order to speed up troubleshooting and resolution:

\- context: provide information about your situation, what you’re trying to accomplish

\- steps to reproduce: list the different steps leading to the error message, and ideally provide the data model file.  If necessary, you may mask information in the model file with File \> Save Obfuscated As…

\- current behavior: describe what happened.  In most case, it is useful to provide screenshots or a short movie capture.&nbsp;

\- expected behavior: explain what result or output you would expect for the operation.  In some cases, it may help to illustrate with a mockup.

\- additional information : provide other details that might help with troubleshooting and a speedy response to your request.

\- log files: information from the application logs can be immensely helpful for our development team to diagnose and resolve the issue, ideally captured immediately after the issue occurred. Log files can be found in Help \> Access Application Logs, or at:

\-- Windows: in the C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\HackoladeLogs directory

\-- Mac/Linux: in the Users/$USER/Documents/HackoladeLogs folder.

&nbsp;

## The XY problem

When creating a ticket for support, it may also be helpful to take into consideration the following...

&nbsp;

The [XY problem](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY\_problem> "target=\"\_blank\"") arises when someone attempts to solve problem X, and uses solution Y in an attempt to solve problem X, then also faces challenges with solution Y. Instead of seeking help for problem X, they request support for solution Y, obscuring the root cause and leading to miscommunication, wasted time, and suboptimal solutions.

&nbsp;

The XY problem is further described [here](<https://xyproblem.info/> "target=\"\_blank\""):&nbsp; In particular, it describes what to do about it:

* Always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted solution.
* If someone asks for more information, do provide details.
* If there are other solutions you've already ruled out, share why you've ruled them out. This gives more information about your requirements.

&nbsp;

The kind of answers you will get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer.

&nbsp;

## Tracking your organization's support requests

For large customers of Hackolade, it might be useful for a person to be able to have a consolidated view of all the tickets of their organization.&nbsp; Hackolade uses the helpdesk solution by [Zendesk.](<https://www.zendesk.com/> "target=\"\_blank\"")&nbsp; You would be tracking your org tickets following these [instructions](<https://urldefense.com/v3/\_\_https:/support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846805530-Submitting-and-tracking-requests-in-the-help-center-Customer-Portal\*topic\_vgd\_mqd\_yy\_\_;Iw\!\!MjXRb4uW6x5k\!Go5HRJbg8MJP-igoFe9N2EEP040b9SP7Iz-nVw3hH-GF1l8sptTcmzZlP5JDbq4Jhj8JEMTX9Ejh9b7DZ5Gp5JtAeYrW0Ue2$> "target=\"\_blank\"").&nbsp; Please follow the steps below:

&nbsp;

\- request from our support to create an organization in our Zendesk platform and provide the domain name or names that should be included.&nbsp; Also include the email addresses of each user who should have the rights to view all their org's tickets (as opposed to the default which is that a viewer can only see their own tickets.)

\- each user who needs to view this portal will need to sign up on [https://hackolade.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/signin](<https://hackolade.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/signin> "target=\"\_blank\"") then click on the Signup link

&nbsp;

![Zendesk signin](<lib/Zendesk signin.png>)

&nbsp;

then fill out the form:

![Zendesk signup form](<lib/Zendesk signup form.png>)

&nbsp;

Once signed up, go to [https://hackolade.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests](<https://hackolade.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests> "target=\"\_blank\"") (you may want to bookmark this link...) and identify yourself if necessary.&nbsp; Then click in the box with your name, and choose My activities:

![Image](<lib/Zendesk Choose My activities.png>)

&nbsp;

Depending on the rights you have been given, you should see just your requests and those for which you were Cc'd, or also your organization requests:

&nbsp;

![Zendesk My activities](<lib/Zendesk My activities.png>)
