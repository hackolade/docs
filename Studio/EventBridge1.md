# EventBridge

As you develop the components for your Amazon EventBridge schema, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding scripts, in AWS CLI EventBridge syntax, that can be directly applied to to the instance (provided appropriate IAM rights)

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).
