# Avro schema

Hackolade dynamically generates Avro schema for the structure created with the application.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

![Avro schema forward-engineering](<lib/Avro schema forward-engineering.png>)

&nbsp;

The schema can also be applied to the Confluent or Pulsar Schema Registry, or to Azure Schema Registry for Event Hubs.
