The users are kindly reminded of the End-User Licensing Agreement terms:&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**License** means the right to use the Product as defined by Authorized Use. License metric is per "per seat", meaning that the number of Authorized Users specified on the Invoice may use the software. A license must be obtained for each device on or from which the Product is used or accessed. When the Product is accessed remotely across using Terminal Server, Remote Desktop, Windows App, virtual machine, Citrix, or an equivalent method, a separate Product license is required to be assigned to each device from which the application is accessed, i.e. not the virtual machine on which the Product is installed.
