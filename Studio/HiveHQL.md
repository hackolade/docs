# Hive HQL

As you develop the model for your Hive tables, columns with their types, and indexes, as well as columns-level constraints, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding HQL scripts.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).
