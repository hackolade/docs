# Lineage capture

Starting with v4.3.10, Hackolade introduced some basic lineage capture capabilities.&nbsp; To be clear, Hackolade is not a data governance suite with fancy lineage visualization and transformation features.&nbsp; It just adds the possibility to enable audit trail capture, which can in turn be used to feed a specialized lineage tool.

&nbsp;

Object lineage states where an object comes from, where it is going, and what (optional) transformations are applied to it as it flows through multiple processes.&nbsp; It helps understand the life cycle of the object.&nbsp; Lineage is the documentation of the life cycle.

&nbsp;

A Hackolade model can be the result of a combination of action such as:&nbsp;

* reverse-engineering of a DDL,&nbsp;
* denormalization actions,&nbsp;
* reverse-engineering of an additional JSON document,&nbsp;
* referencing external definitions,
* generation of an API model
* etc.

&nbsp;

Users may then feed these models, including their lineage capture data to a Data Catalog or a Data Management suite, such as Collibra, IBM InfoSphere DG, or erwin EDGE, etcâ€¦

&nbsp;

Lineage capture can be enabled simply by checking the lineage checkbox property for any Hackolade model.&nbsp; If you wish to enable lineage capture by default for all new models, you may do so in Tools \> Options \> General.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Sources are declared at model level

Once lineage capture is enabled for a model, lineage sources are generally created automatically through operations such as reverse-engineering, denormalization, etc..&nbsp; Lineage sources received a unique identifier for internal tracking and linking purposes.&nbsp; Lineage sources are viewed in the Lineage tab of the Properties Pane.&nbsp; The default source name can be edited with a more friendly and descriptive name, if desired.

&nbsp;

The different source formats available are:&nbsp;

\- instance: typically the database instance from which reverse-engineering is performed

\- file: see list below

\- or model: see list below

&nbsp;

the different file types are:

\- JSON Document

\- JSON Schema

\- Data Definition Language (DDL)

\- XML Schema Definition&nbsp; (XSD)

\- Excel template import

\- API generation

\- reference to an external definition in JSON Schema

\- other

&nbsp;

The different model types are:

\- External reference

\- Copy/Paste/Duplicate

\- Denormalization

\- Reference

\- Other

&nbsp;

While lineage sources are typically created automatically by certain operations, it is also possible to create sources manually.

## Lineage sources are referenced at individual attribute level

A lineage entry is created at the attribute level when it is impacted, referencing the model-level lineage source.&nbsp; It displays the busines name and technical name for the source entity and the source attribute.&nbsp; It is possible to document further with a description and possibly with a transformation.

&nbsp;

## Lineage at the entity level is just a view of attribute level entries

Aside from the description is possible transformation entries, which can be defined, the rest of the information is just a view of attribute-level lineage entries that cannot be edit here.&nbsp; If editing is required, it should be done at the attribute level.
