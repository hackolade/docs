&nbsp;

Clicking the Hackolade logo on the top left of the application window brings a menu of window controls:

![Title bar - window menu](<lib/Title bar - window menu.png>)

You may also double-click the Hackolade logo to close the application.&nbsp; The application will prompt you to save or abandon any unsaved changes, if any.

&nbsp;

On the right, you find 3 icons that control the application window:

* the dash ![Image](<lib/Title bar - Minimize application window.png>)lets you minimize the application
* the square ![Image](<lib/Title bar - Maximize application window.png>)lets you toggle the application window size: smaller or maximized.&nbsp; Once the application is less than maximum, you can then grab a corner with you mouse and adjust width and height, as you would do with any other application.
* the ![Image](<lib/Title bar - Application exit.png>)lets you exit the application.&nbsp; The application will prompt you to save or abandon any unsaved changes, if any.
