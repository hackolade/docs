## License metric "per seat": what does it mean?

License means the right to use the Product as defined by Authorized Use.&nbsp; License metric is "per seat", meaning that the number of Authorized Users specified on the Invoice may use the software.&nbsp; A license must be obtained for each device on or from which the Product is used or accessed.

&nbsp;

If I have a desktop at home and a laptop at work, does it mean that I can use the same license key?&nbsp; **No**, our license metric is not based on named users.&nbsp; A license must be obtained for each device on or from which the Product is used or accessed.

&nbsp;
