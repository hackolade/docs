# Licensing FAQ

## Will I be charged when my 14-day free trial is up?

No. We don’t ask for a credit card to try Hackolade, so we can’t charge you until you decide you want to become a customer. 100% your call, no surprises.

&nbsp;

## What are the best ways to purchase Hackolade Studio?

For small orders, the easiest way to procure a license key is via our online self-service e-commerce platform, accessible from our [pricing page](<https://hackolade.com/pricing.html> "target=\"\_blank\"").&nbsp; Payment is made either via credit card or PayPal.&nbsp; All self-service subscriptions renew automatically until they are canceled by the customer.

&nbsp;

For larger orders, you may purchase direct from us through a process of Quote \> Purchase Order \> Invoice \> Payment.&nbsp; You may also purchase via one our [authorized resellers](<https://hackolade.com/references.html#resellers> "target=\"\_blank\"").&nbsp; Direct subscriptions via purchase order, and via resellers do not renew automatically.

&nbsp;

## Which plan is right for me?

We understand that each organization is unique, requiring specific licensing features to support its workflows and projects. The [feature comparison matrix](<https://hackolade.com/editions.html> "target=\"\_blank\"") lists the differences between the Community, Personal, Professional, and Workgroup editions.&nbsp; We also have a 14-day Free trial, where you can check out all our Professional and Workgroup features and make an informed decision, without putting a credit card on record.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## What if I change my mind?

Subscriptions taken self-service with our e-Commerce platform reseller FastSpring are automatically renewed until canceled.&nbsp; To cancel your subscription at the next renewal date. &nbsp;

## License metric "per seat": what does it mean?

License means the right to use the Product as defined by Authorized Use.&nbsp; License metric is "per seat", meaning that the number of Authorized Users specified on the Invoice may use the software.&nbsp; A license must be obtained for each device on or from which the Product is used or accessed.

&nbsp;

If I have a desktop at home and a laptop at work, does it mean that I can use the same license key?&nbsp; **No**, our license metric is not based on named users.&nbsp; A license must be obtained for each device on or from which the Product is used or accessed.

&nbsp;

My company wants to install Hackolade on a server accessed via Remote desktop: is it possible?&nbsp; **Yes**, Remote Desktop is possible.&nbsp; However, a license seat is required **for each combination of host, user login, and remote client** accessing the application.
