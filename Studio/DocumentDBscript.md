# DocumentDB script

DocumentDB does not provide an abstraction for schemas. In order to provide added-value in forward-engineering, Hackolade provides a JSON document by example for each collection in the model.&nbsp; The script also includes the creation of collection and indexes, and it can be applied to the DocumentDB instance.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

A button lets the user apply to a selected instance the script to create databases, collections with indexes as well as sample data if desired.
