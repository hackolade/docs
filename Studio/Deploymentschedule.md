# Deployment schedule

&nbsp;

\- Architecture \& Design: the architecture of the solutions is super simple and described in this diagram:

&nbsp;

Even when leveraging the browser deployment, the security-first architecture is very simple:

&nbsp;

\- Installation: installation is super simple and takes less than 1 minute per user.

\- Configuration¬†: configuration of connections to the Git repository and databases is done in a few seconds.

\- Migration of existing data models : the length of this step depends on the number of models and whether special adjustments are required.

\- Acceptance Testing : customer may run testing at any time test against a list of specified requirements

\- Knowledge Transfer : Hackolade provides&nbsp; [online user documentation](<WelcometoHackoladeStudio.md>), [tutorials](<Tutorial.md>), [how-to guides](<How-toguides.md>), and an [eLearning platform](<https://community.hackolade.com/slides/all> "target=\"\_blank\"") with self-paced progressive video tutorials.&nbsp;

\- Post-Implementation Support : maintenance and support are provided for as long as the subscription is valid.
