# TinkerPop Gremlin

As you develop the model for your TinkerPop graph database, with vertex labels and edge labels with their respective property keys and indexes, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding Gremlin script.

&nbsp;

The information can be viewed in the Gremlin tab:

You may export these scripts to a Gremlin file with the menu option Tools \> Forward-Engineering \> Gremlin script:
