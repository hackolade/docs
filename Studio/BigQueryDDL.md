# BigQuery DDL

Hackolade dynamically generates the DDL script to create datasets, tables, columns and their data types, for the structure created with the application.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).
