# Diagram objects pane

Starting with v7.4.0, a collapsible pane has been added above the Object Browser.&nbsp; The Diagram Objects pane is there to facilitate the creation of objects in the ERD pane:

&nbsp;

![Diagram Objects pane](<lib/Diagram Objects pane.png>)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you don't want to use the Diagram Objects pane, for example to leave room for a longer Object Browser, you may do so by clicking the caret in the title bar:

![Diagram Objects pane - collapsed](<lib/Diagram Objects pane - collapsed.png>)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Depending on the model target, the wording and number of lines may differ from the image above.&nbsp; Some objects may be disabled depending on the selection made in the ERD.&nbsp; For example, the attribute object is enabled only if you have selected an entity.

&nbsp;

You have different options:

\- click once on the object line: the object will be placed in a default location

\- drag-and-drop the object to the location of your choice (not available for all objects)

\- click the question mark (?) to access the online user documentation.
