## Do you need to obfuscate your data model before you share it?

Use the File \> Save Obfuscated As... function to overwrite all texts so you can safely share sensitive ER Diagrams and structures with clients or partners without fear of breaching non-disclosure clauses or the GDPR.&nbsp; This can be particularly useful to help Hackolade support troubleshoot issues you might encounter.
