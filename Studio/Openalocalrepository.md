# Open a local repository

If you already have a local copy of the remote repository, then you just need to (re-)open it. No need to clone it again.

You have different options for opening a local repository in Hackolade Studio:

* choose Repository \> Open Local Repository in the the top menu;
* use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+O (Cmd+Shift+O on MacOS);
* open the repository context, select "This computer" as source, and click the "Browse" button;
* click the "Open local repository" button in the main pane.

Hackolade Studio remembers previously opened repositories.&nbsp; So you have additional options if you had previously opened that repository:

* choose Repository \> Open Recent Repository in the the top menu;
* open the Repository Context, select "This computer" as source, and open the "Repository" drop-down.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Note that Hackolade Studio automatically reopens the last repository by default when starting the application. You may disable this behavior in Tools \> Options \> Repository.
