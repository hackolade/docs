&nbsp;

A context bar on the left of the screen is provided to allow easy access to important screens of the application, called "contexts".&nbsp; Each context can be accessed by clicking the corresponding icon.

&nbsp;

The contexts are:

\- Welcome page: the home screen seen when you first open the application, with quick access to common tasks, resources, recent models, and recent places.&nbsp; This context is also accessible via the menu View \> Welcome Page.

\- Data model: the main application screen where you create and maintain the opened data model

\- [Repository](<Repository.md>): for the Workgroup Edition, the screen where all repository operations take place: explore, commit, pull push, solve conflict, submit for review, check change:pull requests, and other actions such as merge branch.&nbsp; Note that a blue badge appears in the context bar next to the repository icon, if an action is required.&nbsp; This context is also accessible via the menu Repository \> Open Repository Context.

\- [Compare and Merge Models...](<Compareandmergemodels.md>): the side-by-side screen to compare and merge models.&nbsp; This context is also accessible via the menu Tools \> Compare and Merge Models....

\- [Plugin Manager](<DownloadadditionalDBtargetplugin.md>): the dialog where you can see all available plugins to be downloaded if needed, and maintain installed plugins.&nbsp; This context is also accessible via the menu Help \> Plugin Manager.

\- Options: the dialog where you can maintain many application preferences.&nbsp; This context is also accessible via the menu Tools \> Options.

\- [License Status](<Softwareregistration.md>): the screen where you can validate your license key and view the status of your license key.&nbsp; This context is also accessible via the menu Help \> License Status.
