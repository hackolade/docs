# Glue Data Catalog

As you develop the model for your AWS Glue Data Catalog tables, and columns with their types, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding scripts, both in AWS CLI glue syntax, that can be directly applied to to the instance (provided appropriate IAM rights).

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

&nbsp;

![Glue Data Catalog Forward-Engineering](<lib/Glue Forward-Engineering.png>)

or in HiveQL syntax:

![Glue forward-engineering in HiveQL](<lib/Glue forward-engineering in HiveQL.png>)
