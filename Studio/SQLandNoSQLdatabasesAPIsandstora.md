# SQL and NoSQL databases, APIs, and storage formats

Hackolade's main added value is in providing the ability to perform the data modeling for JSON-based databases, mainly nested objects (sub-documents and arrays, a.k.a. maps and lists.)&nbsp; Hackolade even has a pending patent on its "Method and Process to graphically model schemas for NoSQL and multimodel databases and REST APIs".

&nbsp;

Whereas most relational database adhere to a SQL standard which ensures a common approach (even though some nuances are possible), NoSQL databases have sometimes fundamentally different approaches for storage and architecture, and often use different terminology for similar concepts:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Each target vendor may also support its own functional features and list of attribute types.

&nbsp;

To simplify the user's life, Hackolade adapts to the terminology and feature set of each database platform target for the model.&nbsp; The menu items, contextual menus, toolbar icon tooltips, and documentation all dynamically change depending on the selected target.

&nbsp;

Isn't it ironic that a technology that bears the label of 'schemaless' is also known for the fact that schema design is one of its toughest challenges?&nbsp; Each of the NoSQL vendors dedicates a large part of its documentation to data modeling: [MongoDB](<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/> "target=\"\_blank\""), [DynamoDB](<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GuidelinesForTables.html> "target=\"\_blank\""), [Couchbase](<https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/data-modeling/intro-data-modeling.html> "target=\"\_blank\""), [Cassandra](<http://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/ddl/ddlCQLDataModelingTOC.html> "target=\"\_blank\"").

&nbsp;

The following pages analyze the characteristics of each NoSQL database vendor, from the perspective of a data modeler.&nbsp; These pages do not cover the technical architecture as it pertains to infrastructure and performance, which would go well beyond the scope of the Hackolade application.
