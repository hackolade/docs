# Hackolade Model Hub

The Hackolade Enterprise Model Hub is a metadata collaboration platform providing a unified and central access to your Hackolade Studio data models stored in one or more Git repositories.&nbsp; It empowers business teams, governance teams, and other stakeholders to collaborate efficiently and promote a shared understanding of the context and meaning of data across the organization.

&nbsp;

A demo playground of the Model Hub is available at [https://hub.hackolade.com/](<https://hub.hackolade.com/> "target=\"\_blank\"")&nbsp; Feel free to explore at your leisure.&nbsp; It even allows you to load your own models to the repository, then browse them in the Hub for a personalized evaluation experience.

&nbsp;

**Note:** this repository is public for demonstration purposes, whereas your own repo would of course be private in a production environment.&nbsp; Also, this repo is on GitHub in the cloud.&nbsp; The production solution, if you purchase it, would be integrated with the provider of your choice: Azure DevOps Repos, Bitbucket Cloud, Github Cloud, GitHub Server, GitLab Cloud, or GitLab Server.

&nbsp;

**WARNING:** this demo of the Hackolade Model Hub is totally open to everyone, so we strongly suggest to refrain from loading any confidential information. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Only Hackolade data models are accepted.&nbsp; Hackolade reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content from this repository, or any content that would negatively affect the platform.
