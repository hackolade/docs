&nbsp;

then choose the file on you file system.&nbsp; Hackolade reads interchangeably JSON or YAML files, as long as they respect the OpenAPI specification for [v3.0.x](<https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md> "target=\"\_blank\"") or [v3.1.x](<https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md> "target=\"\_blank\"").
