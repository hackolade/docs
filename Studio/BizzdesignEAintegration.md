# Bizzdesign EA integration

Bizzdesign is the recognized leader in Enterprise Architecture modeling.&nbsp; It is well known for the co-development of ArchiMate, an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language to support the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains in an unambiguous way.

&nbsp;

Hackolade has partnered with Bizzdesign to create an integration allowing Hackolade Studio data model files to be read into Bizzdesign ERDs and into ArchiMate objects.

&nbsp;

This integration is done via custom scripts created under [Viewpoints](<https://help.bizzdesign.com/articles/#\!horizzon-help/view-presentation-types> "target=\"\_blank\"") in BizzDesign.&nbsp; These scripts must be installed by Bizzdesign on your instance of Bizzdesign Enterprise Studio.

&nbsp;

We are currently working on the generation of [Archimate](<https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum> "target=\"\_blank\"") file with data objects in XML format according to the [Archimate 3.1 specification](<https://www.opengroup.org/xsd/archimate/> "target=\"\_blank\"").&nbsp; This artifact generation will be included in an upcoming release.
