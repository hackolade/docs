# Cosmos DB SQL API scripts

As you develop the model for your Cosmos DB SQL API database, with containers and document types, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding forward-engineering script.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

&nbsp;

The information can be viewed in the Cosmos DB script tab:

![Cosmos DB SQL APi script](<lib/Cosmos DB SQL APi script.png>)

&nbsp;

A button lets the user apply to a selected Azure instance the script to create containers, documents, indexes, UDFs, stored procedures, and triggers.

&nbsp;

Or you may export these scripts to a Gremlin file with the menu option Tools \> Forward-Engineering \> Cosmos DB script:

![Cosmos DB SQL API forward-engineering menu](<lib/Cosmos DB SQL API forward-engineering menu.png>)
