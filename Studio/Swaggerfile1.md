# Swagger file

To create a Hackolade model from an existing Swagger specification file is extremely easy:&nbsp; Create a new model with Swagger as the target, then choose Tools \> Reverse-Engineer \> Swagger file

&nbsp;

![Swagger reverse-engineering menu](<lib/Swagger reverse-engineering menu.png>). &nbsp;

&nbsp;

then choose the file on you file system.&nbsp; Hackolade reads interchangeably JSON or YAML files, as long as they respect the [Swagger specification](<https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md> "target=\"\_blank\"").
