# Cosmos DB Gremlin script

As you develop the model for your Cosmos DB Gremlin graph database, with vertex labels and edge labels, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding Gremlin script.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

&nbsp;

The information can be viewed in the Gremlin script tab:

![CosmosDB Gremlin script forward-engineering](<lib/CosmosDB Gremlin script forward-engineering.png>)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A button lets the user apply to a selected Azure instance the script to create graphs, nodes and edges, indexes, UDFs, stored procedures, and triggers

&nbsp;

Or you may apply these scripts to a Gremlin directly to the selected instance with the menu option Tools \> Forward-Engineering \> Gremlin script:
