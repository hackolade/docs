# System requirements

**Important:** For proper operation of the software, the following domains must be whitelisted in your corporate and local networking/firewall/security/anti-malware environment: [https://hackolade.com](<https://hackolade.com> "target=\"\_blank\""),&nbsp; [https://quicklicensemanager.com](<https://quicklicensemanager.com/> "target=\"\_blank\""), [https://qlmdr.com](<https://qlmdr.com> "target=\"\_blank\""), and [https://github.com](<https://github.com> "target=\"\_blank\"")

&nbsp;

In particular, in environments with proxies using SSL inspection (Zscalar, BlueCoat, etc.) it is critical that Hackolade be whitelisted to connect properly with SSL/TLS protocols.

&nbsp;

Hackolade's recommended systems configuration is any of the following platforms:

* **Windows:** Windows 10 Core 2 Duo or better with 4GB+ RAM.&nbsp; Windows Group Policies must allow access to the Command Prompt.&nbsp; Please consult [this article](<ErrormessagespawnUNKNOWN.md>) for additional information.
* **Mac:**&nbsp;
  * Intel processors: OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher, 64-bit only
  * Apple Silicon ARM64 processors: OS X 11 (Big Sur) or above
* **Linux:** 64-bit only Ubuntu 14.04 or higher, and Red Hat RHEL 8 or above.&nbsp; Fedora 24 and Debian 8 might work as well, but have not been verified.&nbsp; CentOS without GUI will NOT work.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Note:** Hackolade does not have any kind of telemetry, and no information on application usage is collected.&nbsp; For all details, please consult our [Privacy Policy](<https://hackolade.com/privacy.html> "target=\"\_blank\"").
