Depending on the setup, one or more of the following fields will need to reference the appropriate file:

## Certificate Authority ##

For production use, your Neo4j deployment should use valid certificates generated and signed by a single certificate authority. You or your organization can generate and maintain an independent certificate authority, or use certificates generated by a third-party SSL vendor.

&nbsp;

To verify the identity of the MongoDB deployment you connect to, provide one or more certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities.

&nbsp;

## Client Certificate ##

If the server is configured to perform certificate validation, you need to provide a certificate here to identify yourself to the server.

&nbsp;

Typical file extensions for the certificate are .crt or .pem.

&nbsp;

## Client Private Key ##

If the server is configured to perform certificate validation, you need to provide the private key here to identify yourself to the server.

&nbsp;

Typical file extensions for the private key are .key or .pem.

&nbsp;

## Private Key Password ##

A private key can optionally be encrypted with a password.

&nbsp;

If your private key is password protected, enter the password here. If not, leave the field blank.
