# Neo4j Cypher

As you develop the model for your Neo4j graph database, with node labels and relationship types with constraints and indexes, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding Cypher script.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

&nbsp;

The information can be viewed in the Cypher Script tab:

![Neo4j forward-engineered Cypher](<lib/Neo4j forward-engineered Cypher.png>)

&nbsp;

You may export these scripts to a Cypher file with the menu option Tools \> Forward-Engineering \> Cypher Script:

![Neo4j forward-engineering Cypher menu](<lib/Neo4j forward-engineering Cypher menu.png>)

&nbsp;
