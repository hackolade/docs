# Clone a remote repository

You may skip this section if you already have a local copy of the remote repository.

&nbsp;

If you don't have a local copy of the remote repository yet, then you first need to clone it.&nbsp; You can do this from Hackolade Studio by following the steps below:

**Important note:** we strongly suggest to **avoid** cloning your repo in a folder which is synchronized with the cloud (OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, etc...)&nbsp; The sync mechanism may cause perverse performance effects and sometimes conflicts with the Git processes.

&nbsp;

* **Open the repository context**.

  * choose Repository \> Open Repository Context in the top menu;
  * use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+G (Cmd+G on MacOS);
  * or switch to the repository context via the icon in the vertical Context Bar on the left;
  * move up or down in the Context bar by using the shorcut Ctrl+Up/Down arrow (Cmd+Up/Down arrow on MacOS).

&nbsp;

* In the top bar, **select "URL" as source**. Every remote repository has a URL to clone it.
* **Provide the URL** of the repository you want to clone.&nbsp; The protocols HTTPS and SSH are both supported.
* **Click on "Clone"**.
* **Select or create the local folder** where you want the remote repository to be cloned.&nbsp; That folder can be located anywhere on your local machine, but must be empty.&nbsp; You will get an error message if it is not.
* **Provide the requested credentials** if needed.&nbsp; Read more about Git authentication [here](<Authentication.md>).

&nbsp;

You're done\!&nbsp; You now have a local copy of the remote repository in the specified folder.&nbsp; And it has been opened automatically.
