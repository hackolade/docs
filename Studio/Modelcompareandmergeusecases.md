# Model compare and merge use cases

No matter how convenient we can make our side-by-side compare and merge screens, the process always requires figuring out first what needs to be compared, and the desired outcome.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are many subtleties in this compare and merge process.&nbsp; We introduce the principles in this how-to guide, then you can apply them in the GUI, following [these instructions](<Compareandmergemodels.md>), before you attempt to optionally automate the process with the CLI.

&nbsp;

You may already know that, when performing a Compare \& Merge operation with Hackolade Studio, the operation does not modify either of the two models being compared.&nbsp; Instead, the process creates a third model -- the merged model.&nbsp; While it may sound counter-intuitive, it is a benefit of using Git technology as a repository.&nbsp; Immutable versions make it super easy to track changes, merge, branch, version, etc. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are many permutations possible.&nbsp; Inside this section of our online documentation, we expose some advanced use cases that should inspire users.
