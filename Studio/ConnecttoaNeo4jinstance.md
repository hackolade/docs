# Connect to a Neo4j instance

To perform the reverse-engineering function, Hackolade connects to the Neo4j instance via the Bolt driver for JavaScript, with some additional improvements for client-side SSL certificates.

&nbsp;

The Connection Settings dialog lets define the parameters in different tabs, as needed:

![Neo4j connection settings](<lib/Neo4j connection settings.png>)

&nbsp;

As an illustration, taking the Neo4j sandox for movie recommendations:

![Neo4j Recommendations Sandbox](<lib/Neo4j Recommendations Sandbox.png>)

copy the IP Address, Bolt Port and paste in the Connection tab

![Neo4j - Connection settings Recommendation ex](<lib/Neo4j - Connection settings Recommendation ex.png>)

&nbsp;

and copy the Username and Password to the Authentication tab:

![Neo4j - Connections setting authentication](<lib/Neo4j - Connections setting authentication.png>)
