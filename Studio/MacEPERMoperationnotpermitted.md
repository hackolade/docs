# Mac EPERM: operation not permitted

Starting with the release of macOS 10.15 Catalina, Apple has introduced a new security feature that ensures that 3rd-party applications are manually granted access to the user's file.&nbsp; Hackolade stores settings and logs in your Documents folder, and it cannot operate without it.&nbsp; So, if prompted with this dialog, you must click OK. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You may still manage this grant if needed in Security \& Privacy:

![Mac Security Privacy](<lib/Mac Catalina Security Privacy.png>)

&nbsp;

To avoid the error "EPERM: operation not permitted", you must grant access to the application as described above.
