# JanusGraph Gremlin

As you develop the model for your JanusGraph database, with vertex labels, edge labels, and indexes, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding schema and corresponding Gremlin script.

&nbsp;

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

&nbsp;

The information can be viewed in the Gremlin script tab:

![JanusGraph forward-engineering](<lib/JanusGraph forward-engineering.png>)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A button lets the user apply to a selected instance the script to create graphs, vertex labels, edge labels, and indexes.&nbsp; Optionally, you can also apply a sample graph.

&nbsp;

Or you may apply these scripts directly with the menu option Tools \> Forward-Engineering \> Gremlin script:
