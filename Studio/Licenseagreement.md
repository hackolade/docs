&nbsp;

(c) Exclusions from Defense Obligation. Hackolade will have no duty to defend any IP Claim to the extent such IP Claim is based on: (i) use of a superseded release of the Product, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current release of the Product and Hackolade timely notified Licensee of the availability of the non-infringing Product at no additional cost; (ii) the combination, operation, or use of the Product with programs or data not furnished by Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction, or with hardware or operating system software other than the hardware platform and operating system with which the Product is designed to function, if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Product without such programs, data, hardware or operating systems; (iii) modification or attempted modification of the Product by anyone except Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction, or use or distributions of such modifications; or (iv) Licensee’s use of the Product in a manner that results in defamation, violates the privacy rights of individuals, transmits material in violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, or uses any proprietary third party content without legally binding consent of such third party.

&nbsp;

(d) To the extent that an IP Claim is excluded from Hackolade’s defense obligation, is based upon the claim that any modifications to the Product or combination of the Product with products, not provided by Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction, infringes or violates any third party, Licensee will defend or settle, at its expense, any action brought against Hackolade provided, however, that: (i) Hackolade shall notify Licensee promptly in writing of any such claim; (ii) Hackolade shall not enter into any settlement or compromise any such claim without Licensee’s prior written consent; (iii) Licensee shall have sole control of any such action and settlement negotiations; and (iv) Hackolade shall provide Licensee with information and assistance, at Licensee’s request and expense, necessary to settle or defend such claim.

The foregoing states the sole liability of Licensee and the exclusive remedy of Hackolade for any infringement of intellectual property rights by the Licensee modifications or combinations or any other items provided by Licensee hereunder.

&nbsp;

(e) Notwithstanding Clause 13(a) above, Hackolade assumes no liability hereunder for, and shall have no obligation to defend Licensee or to pay costs, damages or attorney's fees for, any claim based upon any modifications to any of the Product not approved by Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction or combination of any of the Product with products not approved by Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction.
