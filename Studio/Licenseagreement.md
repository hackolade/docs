&nbsp;

(d) To the extent that an IP Claim is excluded from Hackolade’s defense obligation, is based upon the claim that any modifications to the Product or combination of the Product with products, not provided by Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction, infringes or violates any third party, Licensee will defend or settle, at its expense, any action brought against Hackolade provided, however, that: (i) Hackolade shall notify Licensee promptly in writing of any such claim; (ii) Hackolade shall not enter into any settlement or compromise any such claim without Licensee’s prior written consent; (iii) Licensee shall have sole control of any such action and settlement negotiations; and (iv) Hackolade shall provide Licensee with information and assistance, at Licensee’s request and expense, necessary to settle or defend such claim.

&nbsp;

(e) Notwithstanding Clause 13(a) above, Hackolade assumes no liability hereunder for, and shall have no obligation to defend Licensee or to pay costs, damages or attorney's fees for, any claim based upon any modifications to any of the Product not approved by Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction or combination of any of the Product with products not approved by Hackolade or at Hackolade’s direction.
